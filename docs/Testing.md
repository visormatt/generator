# ğŸ§ª Testing

This repo has been setup to use Jest, CodeCov and Circle CI to keep me in check ğŸ˜†. Have a look at the scripts in our ğŸ“¦ `package.json` for all the available options. The 3 listed below should be enough to get started.

```sh
# Run our jest unit tests
npm run test

# Run jest in "watch" mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specs on our CI server
npm run test:ci
```
